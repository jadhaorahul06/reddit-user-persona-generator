Reddit User Persona Generator 

This project is part of the 48-hour assignment for the **AI/LLM Engineer Internship at BeyondChats**.

It takes a Reddit user profile URL, scrapes their public posts and comments, and generates a detailed **user persona** using GPT. Each persona includes **citations from Reddit posts** to justify the inferred traits.



#Features

-  Scrapes Reddit posts and comments using the Reddit API (`praw`)

-  Outputs results as `.txt` files with linked citations
-  Works with any public Reddit profile
